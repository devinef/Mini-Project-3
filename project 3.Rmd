## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(fivethirtyeight)
view(unisex_names)

```



```{r}

?str_subset()

a = str_subset(unisex_names$name, "a$")
unisexnames_a2 <- data.frame(name = c(a), second_column = c("1":56))
view(unisexnames_a2)

names_joined = unisexnames_a2 %>% inner_join(unisex_names, by = "name") %>% select("name", "total", "male_share", "female_share", "gap")
view(names_joined)


```


Str_subset() is able to filter the dataset to pull *values* that match the criteria input in the search. It is important to note that this function will not create a new dataset of its own, but will instead provide only values, which can be compiled into a dataset through other means. 

A common way in which str_subset() can be used is by filtering by letters. 

- str_subset(data, "n")
- str_subset(data, "n$")
- str_subset(data, "^n")
- str_subset()
